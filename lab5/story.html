        <h1>The Perfect Crime</h1>
        <main>
            <p>It was a peaceful sunny day in the northwestern lower peninsula of Michigan, where my cousins, family and I were all enjoying the third or fourth day of our vacation together in the summer of 2005. However that peace would soon be disrupted due to an atrocious act that I was about to commit. Under normal circumstances as a law-abiding citizen, I would never resort to breaking the law-but circumstances were far from normal: My cousin insulted me! I don't remember the exact details of the horrendous insult, it has since been purged from my mind, but I do know that it was too much for my 7-year-old mind to bear. We continued insulting one another back and forth, and next thing we knew we were faking calling the police reporting each other's mean insults. However, I couldn't let her words go unpunished, so I came up with the *brilliant* idea of actually calling the police on her. Before I thought it over, I heard the operator on the other end of the line ask "911, what's your emergency?" My breath suddenly came up short, and one second of silence later, I frantically ended the call.</p>
            <p>Needless to say, they called back almost immediately, and when my uncle picked up the phone and heard what happened, after confirming there was never any emergency, he was out for blood. He narrowed it down to the two of us, and I *expertly* shifted blame onto my cousin. To make sure we both learned our lesson, he gave us popsicles and told us to sit/play outside for half an hour. That day I paid the cruel price for commiting a crime. However, it was far from a perfect crime...</p>
            <p>What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1248752/quotes/qt0502430">That's where I stashed the chandelier.</a></p>
